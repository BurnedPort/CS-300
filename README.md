# CS-300
This repository contains my final project for CS 300. The project reads course data and prints the Computer Science programâ€™s courses in alphanumeric order.

## Reflection

### What problem was I solving?
The goal was to manage and output course data efficiently. This required storing course information, ensuring the list could be sorted, and printing the results in a clear, ordered format.

### How did I approach the problem?
I focused on understanding how **data structures affect performance**. I chose structures and algorithms that made sense for both storing the data and producing the correct output. This reinforced why data structures are critical for writing efficient programs.

### How did I overcome roadblocks?
I broke the work into steps (loading, storing, sorting, printing) and debugged each part individually. When I hit issues with ordering or parsing, I simplified my test cases until the logic worked consistently.

### How did this expand my approach to software design?
It pushed me to think about **matching the data structure to the task** before coding. Now I consider efficiency and scalability as part of design, not just afterthoughts.

### How did this evolve the way I write programs?
I pay more attention to **readability, maintainability, and adaptability**. Clear structure, comments, and modular functions make it easier to return to the project later or adapt it for new requirements.
